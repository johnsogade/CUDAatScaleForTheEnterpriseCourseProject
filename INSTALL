The project in its current form requires a Coursera Lab environment to execute since this already provides the CUDA environment and no 
other configuration will be needed. The Cuda specs are CUDA Driver, CUDA Runtime, NPP Library are versions 11.7, 11.3,and 11.3.3 respectively.

However, to configure for Unix/Linux environment, the following steps are recommended (after repo is cloned):

(a) Install the Nvidia CUDA toolkit using the appropriate package manager
(b) Ensure that the "Common" folder and its contents from the Nvidia Cuda Samples is placed in the root folder of the project (same location where 'src/' and 
'data/' are located. This folder can be seen here for example: "https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Common".
(c) Run the bash script "build.sh" to build the project executable.
(d) Run the bash script "Run.sh" for a test run (ensure the test images are in 'data/').


Porting this project to the Windows platform shouldnâ€™t be too difficult but is outside the current scope of work.
